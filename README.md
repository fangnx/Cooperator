## Project  Overview
The number of co-op programs may increase at McGill Univeristy in the future. 
The objective of this project is to develop a software system called Co-op-perator
for managing co-op terms for such co-op programs. The project will be completed in a 
team of five students which we will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software 
solution to satisfy the requirements, implement the system, validate the system and develop
a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. Our team has been assigned to 
the student viewpoint which we will build a system that allows student to report the 
co-op acceptance, submit required documents and track their co-op program progress.
